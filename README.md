# Real Estate Market Statistics

This application visualizes Real Estate market statistics such as number of listings, average pricing and other metrics for the real estate market in the US. It illustrates how you can embed visual analytics into your [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) applications using ChartFactor. 

The data is sourced from [Realtor.com](https://www.realtor.com/research/data/) and updated as soon as it becomes available the first days of the month.

This application was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is available online at https://chartfactor.com/real-estate/.

## Running the application locally

```js
git clone https://github.com/Aktiun/real-estate-mkt-stats

npm i
